## Objectives

## Introduction

Carefully explain what the student will do in the challenge.

Explain the "why" behind the challenge. Homework for the sake of homework isn't motivating. 

The module challenge should be the most practical application of the lesson content. It should represent the task or set of tasks that would best prepare the student for an analogous (and likely) real-world scenario.

As you provide a clear overview of the module challenge, make certain that the student (not just you) comprehends the relevance of this challenge in helping them realize their own goals of professional development. **It's vital** they understand how this is applicable in the workplace.

## Completion requirements

Here you'll describe the features and tasks that the student will need to complete in order to finish the module challenge.

Provide all necessary detail in either paragraph form,

1. using

4. list,
- [ ]  or
- [ ]  with
- [ ]  a

Whatever manner most effectively communicates the information (consider whether a specific sequence is required or if illustrating a clear visual hierarchy would be beneficial).

## Stretch goals

Describe the tasks and features that would demonstrate a student's exceptional mastery of these principles — going above and beyond — but that exceeds what is required by the minimum expectations of the module challenge.

You can do this with full paragraphs or by using a checklist.
